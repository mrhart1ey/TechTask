# Tech Task

The tech task involved the creation of a prime finding algorithm, to find primes in a range of numbers. A complete description of my approach is given in the Jupyter notebook. 

Dependencies:  
Jupyter Lab  
The Python libaries: bitarray, tabulate, and unittest.  

4 files have been provided but the two main runnables are "techTaskNotebook.ipynb" and "techTaskTests.py"  

"techTaskNotebook.ipynb" allows you to run the prime finding algorithm, it also contains a description of the algorithm and why it is correct. The notebook also shows the performance difference between two different prime finding algorithms.  

"techTaskTests.py" contains unit tests for my prime finding algorithm.  

To run "techTaskNotebook.ipynb" simply start Jupyter Lab, use the command "jupyter lab", which will load Jupyter Lab in the browser, then search for the file in the Jupyter Lab interface and open it.  

To run the tests simply use the command "python3 techTaskTests.py"
